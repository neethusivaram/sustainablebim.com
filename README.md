# About Sustainable BIM

Sustainable BIM is a knowledge-sharing platform dedicated to promoting the integration of sustainability principles into Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies. Our goal is to serve as a central hub for architects, researchers, and professionals interested in the intersection of sustainability and BIM.

## Why Sustainable BIM Matters

The construction industry is undergoing a transformation, with sustainability at its core. As the world faces environmental challenges, BIM offers a powerful tool for creating more efficient, sustainable designs. We believe that sharing knowledge on how to merge these concepts is key to creating a greener future for all.
